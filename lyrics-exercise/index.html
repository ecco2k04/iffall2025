            <span class="verse-type">[Intro]</span> <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh, ah, ah <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">

            <span class="verse-type">[Verse 1]</span> <br>
            I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm <br>
            This body will never be safe from harm <br>
            Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal <br>
            Touch my skin to keep me whole
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">

            <span class="verse-type">[Verse 2]</span> <br>
            Oh, if only you'd come back to me <br>
            If you laid at my side <br>
            Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">

            <span class="verse-type">[Chorus]</span> <br>
            Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know <br>
            I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow <br>
            Memories fire, the rhythms fall slow <br>
            Black Beauty, I love you so
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="verse-type">[Verse 3]</span> <br>
            Oh, precious, precious, silver and gold <br>
            And pearls in oyster's flesh <br>
            Drop down, we two to serve <br>
            And pray to love <br>
            Born again from the rhythm <br>
            Screaming down from heaven <br>
            Ageless, ageless <br>
            And I'm there in your arms <br>
            See upcoming rock shows <br>
            Get tickets for your favorite artists <br>
            You might also like

            Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know <br>
            I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow <br>
            The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow <br>
            Black beauty, I love you so <br>
            So, slow, so, ah <br>

        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="verse-type">[Verse 4]</span> <br>
            Oh, the welts of your scorn, my love, give me more <br>
            Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more <br>
            Well, it's you I've waited my life to see <br>
        </div>
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="verse-type">[Chorus]</span> <br>
            Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know <br>
            I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow <br>
            The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow <br>
            Black beauty, I love you so <br>
            So, black, black, black beauty
