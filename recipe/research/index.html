    <p>Panna cotta is a traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. It's my favorite dessert, and it feels light and refreshing.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>⅓ cup skim milk</li>

        <li>fresh berries for garnish if you so wish</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.</li>
