    <h1>My Introduction</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h3>
            <p>My name is Katie Pan and I'm a third year Communication Design 
            major.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take 
            this class.</h3>
            <p>I am taking this class because Iâ€™m interested in learning more 
            about web development and the practices that I might use in my career 
            later.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit 
            about it.</h3>
            <p>My limited experience with HTML/CSS/JS came from the CSE131 
            course and the Web Development course at WashU.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h3>
            <p>I hope to flesh out my understanding of HTML and CSS further 
            and learn more about how I could use these later on.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different 
            from designing for paper.</h3>
            <p>Designing for the screen requires a basic understanding of 
            logic in CS as well as understanding the constraints of a screen 
            that paper would not have.</p></li>

        <li><h3>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective 
            design. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p>I think <a href="https://substack.com/home">Substack</a>'s 
            design of this website is practical and sleek for a social media 
            site with a wide range of features. The navigation is clear and 
            visually interesting with adequate spacing in the design.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication.
            Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p>I think <a href="https://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>'s 
            website communicates well. Each icon, line, and block of text effectively 
            communicates its purpose without any extraneous information.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h3>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.notion.com">Notion</a>'s website 
            comes off as sleek and polished but has a large array of features that 
            are simple enough to discover and use.
